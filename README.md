# Introduction to GitHub
Author: Scott Campit

### Why another GitHub tutorial?
Hi there.

There are so many introductory tutorials for using [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs) and [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), which can be daunting to compile and apply to research projects. My goal is to create a concise, step-by-step resource for maintaining your software projects on GitHub.

Everything you need is to get started can be found [here]().

If you have suggestions for improving this tutorial, read more on raising an [Issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) or a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests).
